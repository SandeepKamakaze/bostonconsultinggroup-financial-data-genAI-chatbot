# 📊 AI-Powered Financial Chatbot – BCG GenAI Job Simulation  

This repository contains my work from the **BCG GenAI Job Simulation on Forage (February 2025)**, where I developed an AI-powered financial chatbot. The chatbot is designed to transform complex financial data into actionable insights, making financial analysis more accessible and user-friendly.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
During this simulation, I:

- Used **Python** and **pandas** for financial data extraction and manipulation.  
- Integrated **10-K and 10-Q reports** to analyze key financial metrics.  
- Applied **rule-based logic** to ensure accurate responses to predefined queries.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **pandas** 📊
- **LLM** 🤖
- **NLTK / spaCy** (if applicable) for text processing  
- **JSON / CSV** for data structuring  
- **Regex / Rule-Based Logic** for query handling  

## 📂 Key Features  
✅ Parses financial reports (10-K, 10-Q) for key data points  
✅ Provides user-friendly responses to financial queries  
✅ Uses structured rule-based logic for immediate, accurate answers  
✅ Can be expanded with **NLP & Machine Learning** for enhanced functionality  


## 📌 Future Enhancements
